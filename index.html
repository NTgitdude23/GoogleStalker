        <h1>google stalker</h1>
        <p>Google stalker is a tool to make you realize how much data google collects about you.</p>
        <p>Google allows you to download all the data they have on you, but for the average person (non-techy), this data is just gibberish. Google stalker visualizes the Location data that Google provides using heatmaps, traces, and location markers.</p>
        <h2>Privacy notice</h2>
        Google stalker fully runs clientside. All the data you provide to Google stalker is only visible to the browser locally. If you don't trust me (maybe you shouldn't ;-)), you can download the code from my github <a href="http://github.com/arianvp/GoogleStalker">GoogleStalker</a> and run it locally yourself. For this you will need a Google Maps API key.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>First get a copy of your location from <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/takeout/custom">Google Takout</a> You do this by creating a new archive and just selecting the "Location History" checkbox</p>
        <p>Once the archive is ready, download and unzip it. now hit the browse files button on this webpage and find the folder where you extracted the archive and select "LocationHistory.json"</p>
        <p>Now select a date range that you're interested in. By default Google Stalker will select the biggest range available, but beware that we're crunching a lot of data, so the more data you import, the longer the loading times are gonna be</p>
        <p>Hit "Go stalk me!" and wait.. The browser might seem irresponsive for a while because a lot of data (> 100k entries) are loaded into google maps. The bigger your date range, the slower the process</p>
        <p>Finally a map will be presented to you. You can add markers like "in vehicle" and "on foot" through the settings. When you click on the markers, extra information will be provided</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>

            In this screenshot you can clearly see what I was doing on the 5th of February. I went to the university campus at 16:37. I was at the IKEA at 17:48 and seemed to have spent quite some time there. I was at the train station at 21:46... etc etc.</p>
